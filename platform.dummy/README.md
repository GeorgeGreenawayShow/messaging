# Dummy Platform

This is a fully compliant dummy platform module for the service, it implements a simple HTTP API to 'inject' messages
into the system without using a real service.

## Compliance notice

This service doesn't always send the same platform payload, it can be modified (for testing).
To this end, this service should be removed before going into production.
